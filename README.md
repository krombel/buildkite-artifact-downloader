# buildkite-artifact-downloader
Downloads artifacts from buildkite

 ## Ideas for further development:
 - Transform to an always running program. Therefore I have the following in mind:
   - add config file handling
   - add hooks which will be called once artifacts got downloaded
   - add webserver component e.g. to handle webhooks
